# RemovingBackground

In this project I show how to remove background from a set of images. This is my project for a subject on Warsaw University of Technology.

## What is needed

What you will need to go through this project are 3 things:
1. Install necesserary requirements given in requirements.txt for your python project.
2. Install necesserary databases. I used dataset called plantvillage and a set called Potato___Late_blight https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdallahalidev/plantvillage-dataset you can use any of those or any one you find, however you will have to play with the parameters, to get better outputs.
3. Read my documentation I think might help a little bit to understand what is exactly happening in my work.
